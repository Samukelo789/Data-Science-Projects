2 Credit Card Fraud Detection

Project Overview

This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions, addressing the critical challenge of class imbalance in a real-world application. Using a synthetic dataset (10,000 transactions, ~0.5% fraud) that mimics the structure of the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset, the project implements data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling to identify fraud with high accuracy. The code is executed in Google Colab, leveraging Python libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and imbalanced-learn.

This project showcases skills in data preprocessing, handling imbalanced datasets, model evaluation, and data visualization, making it relevant for roles in data science, machine learning, and financial analytics.

3 Diabetes Prediction

Project Overview

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict diabetes onset using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, a widely used dataset in healthcare analytics. The goal is to classify patients as diabetic (1) or non-diabetic (0) based on diagnostic measurements, addressing challenges like missing values and class imbalance. Implemented in Google Colab, the project leverages Python libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn) to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), modeling, and evaluation.

This project showcases skills in healthcare analytics, data preprocessing, handling imbalanced data, and model interpretability, making it highly relevant for data science, machine learning, and healthcare-focused roles.
