2 Credit Card Fraud Detection

Project Overview

This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions, addressing the critical challenge of class imbalance in a real-world application. Using a synthetic dataset (10,000 transactions, ~0.5% fraud) that mimics the structure of the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset, the project implements data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling to identify fraud with high accuracy. The code is executed in Google Colab, leveraging Python libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and imbalanced-learn.

This project showcases skills in data preprocessing, handling imbalanced datasets, model evaluation, and data visualization, making it relevant for roles in data science, machine learning, and financial analytics.
